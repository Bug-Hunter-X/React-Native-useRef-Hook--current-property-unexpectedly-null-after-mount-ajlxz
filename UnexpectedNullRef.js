This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with a functional component.  The `current` property of the ref is unexpectedly null even after the component has mounted and rendered.  This often happens when attempting to access the `current` property within a function called immediately after the component mounts, such as in an `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array.
