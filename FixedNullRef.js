The issue is resolved by ensuring the ref is accessed only after it's been assigned a value.  Instead of relying on the ref being available immediately, check if `ref.current` is not null before accessing it.  If possible, move code that relies on the ref to a different lifecycle event, such as a separate event handler that ensures the component's elements have been rendered.

```javascript
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';

const FixedNullRef = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Access myRef.current here; it's guaranteed to be assigned
      console.log('Ref is now available:', myRef.current);
    }
  }, [myRef.current]); // Dependency array includes myRef.current

  const handlePress = () => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      // Access myRef.current; it's guaranteed to be assigned
       console.log('Ref is now available:', myRef.current);
    }
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Ref Example</Text>
      <Button title="Click Me" onPress={handlePress} />
      <View ref={myRef}>
          <Text>This is inside the ref</Text>
      </View>
    </View>
  );
};

export default FixedNullRef;
```
